Intro

Our selected NGO is a small local foundation in Piliscsaba.
The goal of the Foundation for Cats is to ensure that every cat has a devoted owner who surrounds him with loving care.
It is true that there would often be less, since if the number of cats waiting for an owner is multiple than the number of owners, then there is no chance that every cat will have an owner.
Our work is therefore focused on making cat owners aware of the need to curb reproduction and financially support those who organize neutering campaigns as activists, as well as those whose unfavorable circumstances prevent them from being able to solve this task alone.
